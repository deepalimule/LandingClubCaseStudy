Case Study-

Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). 
The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. 
In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. 
In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 


Identify the risky loan applicants, such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

Analyse the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, 
i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
